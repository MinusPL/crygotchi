A casual room building, decoration and virtual pet game made in Godot.
This is the FOSS version: all assets, maps, code and included files are released upon GPLv3 license

This repository lets youâ€¥

- Run the open source code to have a fully self-compiled FOSS version of the game
- Propose changes to be merged back into the game.
- Create modifications for Crygotchi that would otherwise be impossible.
- Use helpful code snippets in your projects.
- Create your own "total conversions" that use an entirely new set of assets.

Also, If you would like to distribute any of the original Crygotchi assets for non-Crygotchi assets, you must obtain explicit written permission from CovenFox Studios(Do feel free to @ us on Discord!).
